This is a team project that we built as part of our portfolio project during our Software Engineering Programme. Our project aimed at addressing two of Africa's biggest problems namely, access to income and income generating opportunities. With this in mind, we hoped to bridge this gap by increasing the visibility and accessibility of the biggest workforce i.e the informal sector and effect the much needed technological disruption in this space.
