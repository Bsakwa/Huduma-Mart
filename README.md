# Huduma-Mart :globe_with_meridians:

This is a team project that we built, as part of our portfolio project during our Software Engineering Programme. Our project aimed at addressing two of Africa's biggest problems namely, access to income and income generating opportunities. With this in mind, we hoped to bridge this gap by increasing the visibility and accessibility of the Africa's biggest workforce i.e the informal sector and effect the much needed technological disruption in this space. Our web application provides a platform for service providers to be more visible and accessibile to a vast network of potential clients all the while ensuring clients have a range service providers within their reach at any location and at any given time.
